### Welcome to the AEM6.2 Weather App

This serves as an example of how to use [Sightly / HTL] (https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/htl/overview.html) a HTML Templating Language supported by the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) content management system, while also leveraging the server side JavaScript USE API (which leverages Rhino) as well as the Java USE API, to build templates and components in AEM. You can zip up both root directories and install in your local AEM instance via the CRX package manager.
